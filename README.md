## The Origin Story

This project wasn't born from a playful challenge, but from a universal pain point felt by office workers everywhere: the long, expensive, and often pointless meeting. After sitting through one too many sessions that could have been summarized in a single paragraph, I started to wonder about the real, tangible cost of that wasted time.

I decided to build a tool that does more than just show a running number. I wanted to make the cost *feel* real. This calculator is the resultâ€”a way to visualize the financial impact of a meeting in real-time, hopefully encouraging everyone to be more mindful of each other's most valuable resource: their time.

## Features

* **Dual Modes:** Switch seamlessly between a **Live Timer** for ongoing meetings and a **Static Calculator** for past or future ones.

* **Tangible Milestones:** See the cost translated into real-world items (coffees, video games, vacations) as the meeting progresses.
* **Sharable Live Links:** Generate a unique link to a running timer that you can share with colleagues, keeping everyone in sync.
